# Catalog**.  The catalog contains the endpoint for all services the user/tenant
# has access to - including nova, glance, keystone, swift, ...  We currently
# recommend using the 2.0 *auth api*.

# *NOTE*: Using the 2.0 *auth api* does mean that compute api is 2.0.  We will
# use the 1.1 *compute api*
