            <dt>Q: Can I use DevStack for production?</dt>
            <dd>A: No.  We mean it.  Really.  DevStack makes some implementation choices that are not appropriate for production deployments.  We warned you!</dd>

            <dt>Q: Why a shell script, why not chef/puppet/...</dt>
            <dd>A: The script is meant to be read by humans (as well as ran by computers); it is the primary documentation after all.  Using a recipe system requires everyone to agree and understand chef or puppet.</dd>
    
            <dt>Q: Why not use Crowbar?</dt>
            <dd>A: DevStack is optimized for documentation &amp; developers.  As some of us use <a href="https://github.com/dellcloudedge/crowbar">Crowbar</a> for production deployments, we hope developers documenting how they setup systems for new features supports projects like Crowbar.</dd>
    
            <dt>Q: I'd like to help!</dt>
            <dd>A: That isn't a question, but please do!  The source for DevStack is <a href="http://github.com/openstack-dev/devstack">github</a> and bug reports go to <a href="http://bugs.launchpad.net/devstack/">LaunchPad</a>.  Contributions follow the usual process as described in the <a href="http://wiki.openstack.org/HowToContribute">OpenStack wiki</a> even though DevStack is not an official OpenStack project.  This site is housed in the CloudBuilder's <a href="http://github.com/cloudbuilders/devstack">github</a> in the gh-pages branch.</dd>
    
            <dt>Q: Why not use packages?</dt>
            <dd>A: Unlike packages, DevStack leaves your cloud ready to develop - checkouts of the code and services running in screen. However, many people are doing the hard work of packaging and recipes for production deployments.  We hope this script serves as a way to communicate configuration changes between developers and packagers.</dd>
    
            <dt>Q: Why isn't $MY_FAVORITE_DISTRO supported?</dt>
            <dd>A: DevStack is meant for developers and those who want to see how OpenStack really works.  DevStack is known to run on the distro/release combinations listed in <code>README.md</code>.  DevStack is only supported on releases other than those documented in <code>README.md</code> on a best-effort basis.</dd>

            <dt>Q: What about Fedora/RHEL/CentOS?</dt>
            <dd>A: Fedora and CentOS/RHEL are supported via rpm dependency files and specific checks in <code>stack.sh</code>.  Support will follow the pattern set with the Ubuntu testing, i.e. only a single release of the distro will receive regular testing, others will be handled on a best-effort basis.</dd>

            <dt>Q: Are there any differences between Ubuntu and Fedora support?</dt>
            <dd>A: LXC support is not complete on Fedora ; Quantum is not fully supported on Fedora <18 due lack of OpenVSwitch packages.</dd>

            <dt>Q: Can DevStack handle a multi-node installation?</dt>
            <dd>A: Indirectly, yes.  You run DevStack on each node with the appropriate configuration in <code>localrc</code>.  The primary considerations are turning off the services not required on the secondary nodes, making sure the passwords match and setting the various API URLs to the right place.</dd>
    
            <dt>Q: How can I document the environment that DevStack is using?</dt>
            <dd>A: DevStack includes a script (<code>tools/info.sh</code>) that gathers the versions of the relevant installed apt packages, pip packages and git repos.  This is a good way to verify what Python modules are installed.</dd>

            <dt>Q: How do I turn off a service that is enabled by default?</dt>
            <dd>A: Services can be turned off by adding <code>disable_service xxx</code> to <code>localrc</code> (using <code>n-vol</code> in this example):
              <pre>disable_service n-vol</pre>
            </dd>

            <dt>Q: Is enabling a service that defaults to off done with the reverse of the above?</dt>
            <dd>A: Of course!
              <pre>enable_service qpid</pre>
            </dd>

            <dt>Q: How do I run a specific OpenStack milestone?</dt>
            <dd>A: OpenStack milestones have tags set in the git repo.  Set the appropriate tag in the <code>*_BRANCH</code> variables in <code>localrc</code>.  Swift is on its own release schedule so pick a tag in the Swift repo that is just before the milestone release.  For example:
              <pre>GLANCE_BRANCH=stable/essex
HORIZON_BRANCH=stable/essex
KEYSTONE_BRANCH=stable/essex
NOVA_BRANCH=stable/essex
GLANCE_BRANCH=stable/essex
QUANTUM_BRANCH=stable/essex
SWIFT_BRANCH=1.4.8</pre>
            </dd>
<!---  this is incomplete, remove it until populating the sql catalog is complete
            <dt>Q: How do I use the SQL catalog backend in Keystone?</dt>
            <dd>A: Comment out the template backend lines in the <code>[catalog]</code> section of <code>keystone/etc/keystone.conf</code> and add the SQL backend config like this:
              <pre>[catalog]
#driver = keystone.catalog.backends.templated.TemplatedCatalog
#template_file = ./etc/default_catalog.templates
driver = keystone.catalog.backends.sql.Catalog</pre>
            </dd>
-->
            <dt>Q: Why not use <code>tools/pip-requires</code> to grab project dependencies?</dt>
            <dd>The majority of deployments will use packages to install OpenStack that will have distro-based packages as dependencies.  DevStack installs as many of these Python packages as possible to mimic the expected production environemnt.</dd>

            <dt>Q: What can I do about RabbitMQ not wanting to start on my fresh new VM?</dt>
            <dd>A: This is often caused by <code>erlang</code> not being happy with the hostname resolving to a reachable IP address.  Make sure your hostname resolves to a working IP address; setting it to 127.0.0.1 in <code>/etc/hosts</code> is often good enough for a single-node installation.  And in an extreme case, use <code>clean.sh</code> to eradicate it and try again.</dd>
